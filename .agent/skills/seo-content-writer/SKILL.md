# Flutter SEO Content Writer Skill

This skill is specialized in creating comprehensive, search-engine-optimized content focused on the Flutter ecosystem. It ensures that technical tutorials and articles are both developer-friendly and search-engine visible.

## Capabilities
- **Technical Keyword Research**: Identifying trending Flutter topics (e.g., Riverpod vs Bloc, Flutter Web, Performance Optimization, Gemini AI in Flutter).
- **Code-Centric Structuring**: Creating outlines that balance explanation with high-quality code snippets.
- **Tutorial Drafting**: Writing step-by-step guides that follow Flutter best practices.
- **Developer Metadata**: Crafting titles and descriptions that appeal to both search engines and the developer community.

## Guidelines for Use

1. **Target Audience**: Most readers will be developers. Use technical terms correctly but explain complex concepts naturally.
2. **Code Snippets**:
   - Every Flutter article should include clean, commented Dart code.
   - Use proper markdown formatting for code blocks.
3. **Keyword Integration (Flutter Specific)**:
   - Primary keywords: e.g., "Flutter Tutorial", "Best State Management in Flutter".
   - Secondary keywords: "Dart language", "Widget tree", "Flutter performance", "Cross-platform development".
4. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Use H2 for main steps and H3 for sub-steps or specific technical details.
   - Use bullet points for lists of features or pros/cons.
5. **Up-to-Date Information**: Always check the latest Flutter/Dart version trends and features before writing.

## Workflow

1. **Research**: Search for the latest Flutter documentation and top-ranking developer blogs for the chosen topic.
2. **Technical Outline**: Propose a structure that includes "Introduction", "Prerequisites", "Core Implementation" (with code), "Best Practices", and "Conclusion".
3. **Drafting**: Write the content ensuring Dart/Flutter naming conventions are followed (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables).
4. **Optimization**: Add meta-tags tailored for platforms like Medium, Dev.to, and Google Search.
